                                and open it in your IDE.

                                There is no need to build the code - you won't be running it locally! This code is
                                already running remotely and
                                waiting for you to observe it using Lightrun.

                                In the same IDE, install (if you haven't yet) and log in to the Lightrun plugin.

                            <li>
                                In the browser, log in to <a href="#" class="underlinesLink">the demo</a> and click an
                                item to like it; click again to unlike.

                            output the user's name each time a user likes an item.

                                incoming log messages. There may be a few second delay before
                                the logs you're expecting begin showing up.

                        Each of the items has a name in the item_name_map. Each name starts with a different letter of
                        the alphabet, A through Z. <br/> <strong>Use a snapshot to figure out which two letters are
                        unused.</strong>
