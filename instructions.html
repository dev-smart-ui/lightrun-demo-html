                <p>
                    Try to solve the following questions by using Lightrun to observe
                    the behavior of the remotely running application.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraphSpace">
                    From #4 on, as you solve the challenges, send your solution to
                    <strong>moshes@lightrun.com</strong> - let's see who gets there
                    first

                                First download the
                                <a href="#" class="underlinesLink">application's source code</a>
                                and open it in your IDE.

                                There is no need to build the code - you won't be running it locally! This code is
                                already running remotely and
                                waiting for you to observe it using Lightrun.

                                In the same IDE, install (if you haven't yet) and log in to the Lightrun plugin.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In the browser, log in to <a href="#" class="underlinesLink">the demo</a> and click an
                                item to like it; click again to unlike.
                            </li>

                            output the user's name each time a user likes an item.

                                <strong>NOTE:</strong> You will need to switch to the Lightrun Console to view
                                incoming log messages. There may be a few second delay before
                                the logs you're expecting begin showing up.

                    <li>
                        Each of the items has a name in the item_name_map. Each name starts with a different letter of
                        the alphabet, A through Z. <br/> <strong>Use a snapshot to figure out which two letters are
                        unused.</strong>

                                The system will select as "winner" the first user who has X or

                                The contest is run by <a href="#" class="underlinesLink">a separate script</a> which
                                interacts with

                                open it in your IDE, and find
                                the conditions (X and Y) necessary to win. Can you be first to
                                get the "you've won" banner?

                        It's actually possible to cheat and win the
                        contest, even if it's already been won.
